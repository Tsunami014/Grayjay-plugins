# My Grayjay plugins
I am making multiple, as seen below

Current status: [![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/Tsunami014/My-Grayjay-plugin/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Tsunami014/My-Grayjay-plugin/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)
## Medium.com
**Version**: `N/A`

This plugin is not actually possible yet, because they still have yet to develop something for articles, currently only platform posts are supported and it doesn't work with that, but I'm keeping the js file in case they add it in
## Youtube music
**Version**: `2`

This is a work in progress. Currently you can see *something* work, but it isn't much so if you're looking for a fully developed plugin, check back later.

You can actually install it by this url: `https://tsunami014.github.io/Grayjay-plugins/YTMusicConfig.json` OR by this QR Code: [![frame](TYM-QR.png)](https://tsunami014.github.io/Grayjay-plugins/YTMusicConfig.json)

## Spotify
**Version**: `N/A`

Will work on after the Youtube Music one
