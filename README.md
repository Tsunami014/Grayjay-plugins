# My Grayjay plugins
I am making multiple, as seen below

Current status: [![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/Tsunami014/My-Grayjay-plugin/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Tsunami014/My-Grayjay-plugin/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)
## Medium.com
This plugin is not actually possible yet, because they still have yet to develop something for articles, currently only platform posts are supported and it doesn't work with that, but I'm keeping the js file in case they add it in
## Youtube music
This is a work in progress. Currently you can see *something* work, but it isn't much so if you're looking for a fully developed plugin, check back later.

You can actually install it by this url: `https://tsunami014.github.io/My-Grayjay-plugin/YTMusicConfig.json` OR by this QR Code: [![frame](https://github.com/Tsunami014/My-Grayjay-plugin/assets/96847801/f25b6d8e-0122-480b-a369-af0e073c9b46)]()

And please ignore the signature invalid/missing warning I need to somehow fix that and I have no clue how to but that's a problem for once this is finished anyways

## Spotify
Will work on after the Youtube Music one
