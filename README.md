# My Grayjay plugins
 This is a work in progress and a bit of a mess rn, so check back later
 I am making multiple:
 - A plugin for the site Medium, which is not actually possible yet
 - A plugin for Youtube Music, a work in progress: You can actually install it by this url: `https://tsunami014.github.io/My-Grayjay-plugin/YTMusicConfig.json` OR by this QR Code: [![frame](https://github.com/Tsunami014/My-Grayjay-plugin/assets/96847801/f25b6d8e-0122-480b-a369-af0e073c9b46)]()

 - A plugin for Spotify, will work on after the above
